    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='elephant.png')}}" class="imagem"/>
    <div class="animal">
        <h2>Elephants</h2>
        <p>Elephants are one of the most iconic and beloved animals on the planet, but they are also one of the most
            threatened. There are two species of elephants: African and Asian. Both species are facing serious threats from
            habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.
        
            African elephants are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with a declining
            population due to poaching for ivory and habitat loss. Asian elephants are also listed as endangered, with a
            declining population due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and human-elephant conflict.
        
            Conservation efforts for elephants include protecting their habitats, reducing human-elephant conflict, and
            fighting the illegal trade in ivory. By supporting organizations that work to protect elephants and their
            habitats, we can help ensure a future for these magnificent creatures.</p>

        <p>The wild horse is a species of the horse family, Equidae, that is native to the steppe and forest-steppe
            areas of central Asia, Mongolia, and northern China. It is considered endangered due to habitat loss,
            hunting, and competition for resources with domestic livestock.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="animal">
        <h2>Przewalski's horse</h2>
        <p>Przewalski's horse, also called the Mongolian wild horse or Dzungarian horse, is a rare and endangered horse
            native to the steppes of central Asia. It was declared extinct in the wild in the 1960s, but has since been

        <h2>Konik horse</h2>
        <p>The Konik is a small horse breed that originated in Poland and is used for conservation grazing. It is
            considered endangered due to loss of habitat and crossbreeding with domestic horses.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-top: 80px; text-align: center; font-size: 36px; margin-top: 50px;">The 8 most Endangered Animals: </h1>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Javan Rhinoceros</h2>
            <p>This rhinoceros is one of the rarest large mammals in the world, with only around 72 individuals left in
                the wild. They have a single horn on their nose, and their skin is dark gray and heavily wrinkled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Vaquita (like a dolphin)</h2>
            <p>The vaquita is the world's smallest cetacean (the group that includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises)
                and is found only in the northern Gulf of California. They have dark patches around their eyes and lips
                and a gray back with a lighter underside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Sumatran elephant</h2>
            <p>The Sumatran elephant is the smallest of the Asian elephants and is found only on the island of Sumatra.
                They have smaller ears than their African cousins and have a more arched back. They also have a longer
                tail and two finger-like projections at the tip of their trunk.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Gorilla</h2>
            <p>This gorilla is the most widespread and numerous of the gorilla subspecies, but their population has
                declined by more than 60% over the past 20-25 years. They have dark fur and a characteristic sagittal
                crest on their head, which is more pronounced in adult males.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Amur leopard</h2>
            <p>The Amur leopard is one of the rarest big cats in the world, with fewer than 100 individuals left in the
                wild. They have a thick, spotted coat of fur that provides excellent camouflage in their forest habitat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Leatherback sea turtle</h2>
            <p>The leatherback is the largest of all sea turtles and can weigh up to 2,000 pounds. They have a unique,
                flexible shell that is covered in a leathery skin instead of hard plates like other turtles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>South China tiger</h2>
            <p>This tiger is one of the 10 recognized subspecies of tiger and is considered one of the most endangered
                big cats in the world. They have a distinctive pattern of dark stripes on their orange coat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Saola</h2>
            <p>The saola is a critically endangered antelope-like species found only in the Annamite Mountains of
                Vietnam and Laos. They have two parallel horns on their head that can reach up to 20 inches in length.
